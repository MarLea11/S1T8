// TODO: 1. Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called reverse().
//  This method must receive and must return a String.
//  2. In the main() of the main class, it injects into the interface created using a lambda, the body of the method,
//  so that it returns the same string that it receives as a parameter but in reverse.
//  3. It invokes the interface instance by passing it a string and checks if the result is correct.
